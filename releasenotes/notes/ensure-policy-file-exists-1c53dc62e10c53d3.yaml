    The upstream services are moving their policy files into code which means
    they may not exist if a user tries to customize the policies. We've added
    an file resource to openstacklib::policy::base to ensure the file exists
    but this means that the user/group need to be passed into the module or
    it will possibly lock out services from being able to read this file as
    the defaults limit it to just root:root.
